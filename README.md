# Amazon PrimeAir - Drone Delivery Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing drone delivery hub locations for Amazon PrimeAir in Massachusetts. By analyzing e-commerce trends, drone technology capabilities, population demographics, and geographical data, we designed a hub-and-spoke model to maximize efficiency and coverage.

## Key Objectives
- Identify optimal drone hub locations using demographic and geographic data.
- Optimize last-mile delivery using Amazon MK30 drones.
- Improve operational efficiency through strategic planning and route optimization.
- Analyze weather patterns to determine drone delivery feasibility.
- Ensure compliance with FAA regulations and geofencing for restricted airspaces.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Microsoft Excel, Batchgeo.com, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Mapping & GIS:** Simple Maps, U.S. Census Bureau Data, Zonhack
- **Optimization & Forecasting:** Statistical modeling, Amazon warehouse data analysis
- **Drone Technology:** Amazon MK30 Drone, UAV Forecast
- **Regulatory Compliance:** FAA Regulations, Massachusetts Airspace Laws
- **E-commerce Analysis:** Statista, Capital One Shopping, Landing Cube

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathered Massachusetts demographic and geographic data.
   - Collected e-commerce sales data and delivery trends.
   - Analyzed Amazon MK30 drone specifications and limitations.

2. **Data Processing & Analysis**
   - Identified suburban and semi-urban areas suitable for drone hubs.
   - Analyzed seasonal weather conditions and wind speeds.
   - Used GIS tools to map delivery coverage and population reach.

3. **Optimization & Implementation**
   - Developed a hub-and-spoke model for efficient drone dispatch.
   - Optimized delivery routes and drone cycles for maximum efficiency.
   - Evaluated cost-effectiveness and sustainability impact.

## Key Findings
- The proposed network covers **49.26% of Massachusetts’ population** (3.44 million residents).
- **12 strategically placed hubs** ensure efficient and timely deliveries.
- Amazon MK30 drones can deliver **86% of Amazon’s lightweight products**.
- Estimated **1,372 drones** are required for optimal operations.
- Seasonal weather variations impact delivery feasibility, requiring operational adjustments.

## Future Scope
- Expand hub network based on demand and regulatory advancements.
- Integrate machine learning for predictive demand analysis.
- Improve drone battery efficiency for extended range and payload capacity.
- Explore cost reduction strategies to enhance financial viability.
